# Upgrading Spiderpool Versions

This document describes breaking changes, as well as how to fix them, that have occurred at given releases.
Please consult the segments from your current release until now before upgrading your spiderpool.


## Upgrade to 0.3.6 from (<=0.3.5)

### Description

There's a design flaw for SpiderSubnet feature in auto-created IPPool label.
The previous label `ipam.spidernet.io/owner-application` corresponding value uses '-' as separative sign.
For example, we have deployment `ns398-174835790/deploy398-82311862` and the corresponding label value is `Deployment-ns398-174835790-deploy398-82311862`.
It's very hard to unpack it to trace back what the application namespace and name is.

Now, we use '_' rather than '-' as slash for SpiderSubnet feature label `ipam.spidernet.io/owner-application`, and the upper case
will be like `Deployment_ns398-174835790_deploy398-82311862`

### Operation steps

1. Find all auto-created IPPools, their name format is `auto-${appKind}-${appNS}-${appName}-v${ipVersion}-${uid}` such as `auto-deployment-default-demo-deploy-subnet-v4-69d041b98b41`.

2. Replace their label, just like this:

   ```shell
    kubectl patch sp ${auto-pool} --type merge --patch '{"metadata": {"labels": {"ipam.spidernet.io/owner-application": ${AppLabelValue}}}}'
   ```

3. Update your Spiderpool components version and restart them all.
